  <p>This game was created as part of the Webfest 2015 at CERN. For more information see on the <a href="https://webfest.web.cern.ch/"> Webfest Homepage</a>.</p>

  <p>The game is following the example of the historic game "Snake". It connects aspects of game with learning particle physics. So the two main goals are EDUCATION and FUN.</p>

  <p>The project is based on open source. The main libary used is create.js. The whole source code can be accessed by GitHub. Just check the project <a href="ttps://github.com/snaky-particles"> snaky-particles</a>.</p>
